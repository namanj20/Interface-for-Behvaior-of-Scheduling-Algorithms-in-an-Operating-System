With the help of the TKINTER library we have created an application to stimulate scheduling algorithms in any operating system.
    
There are a total of 9 algorithms implemented in python using in-house logic and each algorithm is highly customised to produce accurate results

TKINTER allowed for an appealing and user-friendly GUI through the use of Windows, Frames and etc.

Using various TKINTER widgets, I was able to display Process Table, Gantt Charts, Ready Queue, Radio Buttons and etc.
